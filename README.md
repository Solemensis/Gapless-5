- **BIG NOTE:** This is the forked and edited version of original gapless-5 by [regosen](https://github.com/regosen/) <br>
- **What's Edited?:** Audio panning feature added but only works for Web Audio API audios.
- **How To Pan?:** You can find info about it at the bottom "Options" and "Parameterized Functions" sections.

------------------------

A gapless JavaScript/CSS audio player for HTML5

**PROBLEM**: There are 2 modern APIs for playing audio through the web, and both of them have problems:

- **HTML5 Audio**: the last chunk of audio gets cut off, making gapless transitions impossible
- **WebAudio**: can't play a file until it's fully loaded

**SOLUTION**: Use both!

- If WebAudio hasn't fully loaded yet, it begins playback with HTML5 Audio, then seamlessly switches to WebAudio once loaded.

## Features

- Players can have multiple tracks
- Pages can have multiple players
- Memory management (see `loadLimit` under options)
- Seamless transitions between tracks
  - Pre-loading of subsequent tracks
  - Files don't need to be fully loaded to start playback
- Track shuffling during playback
- Optional built-in UI

## Browser Support

- Safari (including iOS)
- Chrome (including Android)
- Firefox
- Other browers (UI untested, but they probably work as well)

_NOTE for Boostrap users: Bootstrap's CSS will mess up the optional built-in UI. If you don't need Bootstrap in its entirety, try using Twitter customize to get just the subset of rules you need._

## Getting Started

### Using npm

1. Install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@regosen/gapless-5):

```shell
$ npm install @regosen/gapless-5
```

2. Import `Gapless5` from the module:

```js
const { Gapless5 } = require("@regosen/gapless-5");
```

### Using direct HTML

A. If not using built-in UI, just add and reference `Gapless5.js` from your HTML head.

```html
<script src="gapless5.js" language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

B. If using the built-in UI, add and reference `Gapless5.js` and `Gapless5.css`. Also, create a `<div>` or `<span>` element where you want the player to appear. Give it a particular id.

```html
<link href="gapless5.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="gapless5.js" language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- then in body: -->
<div id="gapless5-player-id" />
```

### How it Works

1. Create a `Gapless5` object with an optional parameter object
   - If you want the built-in UI, pass in the element ID as `guiId` under options.
2. Add tracks via options in constructor or `addTrack()`
3. Optional stuff:
   - Manipulate tracklist with `insertTrack()`, `removeTrack()`, and more.
   - Register your own callbacks.
   - Connect key presses to actions using `mapKeys()` or options in constructor.

```js
const player = new Gapless5({ guiId: "gapless5-player-id" });

// You can add tracks by relative or absolute URL:
player.addTrack("audio/song1.mp3");
player.addTrack("https://my-audio-site.org/song2.m4a");

// You can also let the user upload tracks from a file loader like this:
const files = document.getElementById("my-file-input").files;
files.forEach((file) => {
  player.addTrack(URL.createObjectURL(file)); // this creates a 'blob://' URL
});
player.play();
```

_If you want the user to upload tracks from a file loader, here's an example of that:_

```html
<form>
  <input type="file" id="my-file-input" accept="audio/*" />
</form>
```

### Options

These can be passed into a `Gapless5` constructor, or (with the exception of `tracks` and `guiId`) set later on the object.

- **guiId**
  - id of existing element (i.e. `div` or `span`) where you want the player to appear.
  - if empty or not provided, Gapless5 won't use built-in UI.
- **tracks**
  - path to audio file(s) or blob URL(s), see examples above
  - can be a single track as a string, an array, or a JSON object containing an array of JSON objects
- **loop**
  - default = false
  - loops after end of list/track
- **singleMode**
  - default = false
  - plays/loops single track only
- **exclusive**
  - default = false
  - stops other Gapless5 players when this one is playing
- **startingTrack**
  - default: 0
  - either an array index into the tracks array, or the string "random" for a random index
- **shuffleButton**
  - default = true
  - adds shuffle button to the player UI
- **shuffle**
  - default = false
  - enables shuffle mode immediately after playlist load
- **useHTML5Audio**
  - default = true
  - if you don't care about immediate playback, set useHTML5Audio to false for lower memory usage
- **useWebAudio**
  - default = true
  - if you don't care about gapless playback, set useWebAudio to false for better performance
- **loadLimit**
  - default = no limit
  - limits how many tracks can be loaded at once. If you have a large playlist, set to a low number (like 2-5) to save on memory
  - caveat: you will hear gaps/loading delays if you skip tracks quickly enough or jump to arbitrary tracks
- **volume**
  - default = 1.0 (0 = silent, 1.0 = loudest)
- **pan** (Works only with Web Audio API)
  - default = 0 (0 = center, -1.0 = 100% left, 1.0 = 100% right)
- **playbackRate**
  - default = 1.0
  - multiplier for the playback speed, higher = plays faster, lower = plays slower
- **mapKeys**
  - pressing specified key (case-insensitive) will trigger any Action function listed above.
- **logLevel**
  - minimum logging level (default = `LogLevel.Info`)
  - set this to `LogLevel.Debug` for more verbose logging

Example:

```js
const player = new Gapless5({
  tracks: ["loop1.mp3", "loop2.mp3"],
  loop: true,
  loadLimit: 2,
  mapKeys: { prev: "a", playpause: "s", stop: "d", next: "f" },
});
```

### Functions

You can call these functions on `Gapless5` objects.

#### Parameterized Functions:

- **addTrack(audioPath)**
  - adds track to end of playlist
  - `audioPath`: path to audio file(s) or blob URL(s), see examples above
- **insertTrack(index, audioPath)**
  - inserts track at location `index`
  - `audioPath`: same as in addTrack
- **replaceTrack(index, audioPath)**
  - replaces track at location `index`
  - `audioPath`: same as in addTrack
- **gotoTrack(indexOrPath)**
  - jumps to specified track
  - `indexOrPath` can be the numerical index, or audio path
- **queueTrack(indexOrPath)**
  - similar to `gotoPath`, but waits for current track to finish first
- **removeTrack(indexOrPath)**
  - removes specified track from playlist
  - `indexOrPath` can be the numerical index, or audio path
- **setPosition(position)**
  - updates the current position (in milliseconds)
- **setVolume(volume)**
  - updates the volume in real time (between 0 and 1)
- **setPan(pan)** (Works only with Web Audio API)
  - updates the pan in real time (between -1 and 1)
- **setPlaybackRate(playbackRate)**
  - updates the playback speed in real time (see `playbackRate` option)
- **mapKeys(jsonMapping)**
  - pressing specified key (case-insensitive) will trigger any Action function listed below.
  - `jsonMapping` maps an action to a key, see example code below

#### Accessors:

- **isShuffled()**
  - returns true if shuffled
- **getTracks()**
  - returns list of audioPaths in play order
  - if shuffled, the shuffled order will be reflected here
- **getIndex()**
  - returns current index in the playlist
- **getPosition()**
  - returns current play position in milliseconds
- **findTrack(audioPath)**
  - returns index of track in playlist

#### Actions (can be mapped to keys via `mapKeys`):

_These correspond to built-in UI buttons_

- **prev()**: matches behavior of "prev" button (scrubs to start if you've progressed into a track)
- **playpause()**: matches behavior of "play/pause" button
- **stop()**: matches behavior of "stop" button
- **toggleShuffle()**: switches between shuffled and un-shuffled
  - subsequent shuffles will be different each time
- **next()**: matches behavior of "next" button

_These do not correspond to built-in UI buttons_

- **prevtrack()**: unlike "prev" button, this will always jump to the previous track
- **cue()**: play from start
- **play()**: non-togglable "play"
- **pause()**: non-togglable "pause"
- **shuffle(preserveCurrent = true)**: non-togglable shuffle, re-shuffles if previously shuffled
  - if **preserveCurrent** is false, it will shuffle all tracks (without preserving current track)
- **removeAllTracks()**: clears entire playlist

Examples:

```js
player.mapKeys({ cue: "7", stop: "8", next: "9" });

player.play();
player.pause();

// indexes start at 0
player.replaceTrack(0, "audio/song1_alt.flac");
player.insertTrack(1, "audio/transition.wav");

player.gotoTrack(1);
player.gotoTrack("audio/song1_alt.flac"); // can also goto track by path

player.removeTrack(2);
player.removeTrack("audio/transition.wav"); // can also remove track by path
player.removeAllTracks();
```

### Callbacks

You can set these on a `Gapless5` object. All callbacks include the affected track's audio path except where indicated.

```ts
// play requested by user
onplayrequest = (track_path: string) => void

// play actually starts
onplay = (track_path: string) => void

// play is paused
onpause = (track_path: string) => void

// play is stopped
onstop = (track_path: string) => void

// prev track, where:
//   from_track = track that we're switching from
//   to_track = track that we're switching to
onprev = (from_track: string, to_track: string) => void

// next track, where:
//   from_track = track that we're switching from
//   to_track = track that we're switching to
onnext = (from_track: string, to_track: string) => void

// loading started
onloadstart = (track_path: string) => void

// loading completed
onload = (track_path: string) => void

// track unloaded (to save memory)
onunload = (track_path: string) => void

// track failed to load or play
onerror = (track_path: string, error?: Error | string) => void

// track finished playing
onfinishedtrack = (track_path: string) => void

// entire playlist finished playing
onfinishedall = () => void
```

Example:

```js
function nextCallback(from_track, to_track) {
  console.log(`User skipped to next track (from ${from_track} to ${to_track})`);
}

const player = new Gapless5({
  guiId: "gapless5-player-id",
  tracks: ["track1.mp3", "track2.mp3"],
});
player.onnext = nextCallback;
player.onplay = function (track_path) {
  console.log(`Now playing ${track_path}`);
};
```
